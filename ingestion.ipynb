They want a trial, they want a huge fine, and they want Boeing leaders to face charges.\\n\\nIn a legal filing late Sunday — minutes before a midnight deadline — the Justice Department disclosed the agreement and said the fraud charge was “the most serious readily provable offense” it could bring against Boeing. Prosecutors say Boeing will pay another $243.6 million fine, matching a fine it paid in 2021 for the same crime.\\n\\nThe Justice Department says a conviction for fraud will hold Boeing accountable for “misstatements” it made to regulators who certified the 737 Max in 2017. The crashes took place less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nThe company still faces investigations into the blowout of a panel from an Alaska Airlines Max in January, increased oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration, and accusations from current and former employees about poor workmanship and retaliation against whistleblowers.\\n\\nHere is what to know about the case and what could be next for Boeing:\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhat did Boeing admit?\\n\\nBoeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States — in this case, deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration.\\n\\nThe Justice Department first filed that charge in 2021, but it agreed not to prosecute Boeing if it paid a fine and successfully completed three years of a form of corporate probation under what is called a deferred-prosecution agreement.\\n\\nREAD: Boeing in turmoil: Incidents and investigations\\n\\nIn May, however, the department determined that Boeing had not lived up to that agreement, setting in motion the events that led to Sunday’s plea deal.\\n\\nThe plea deal could help Boeing resolve a black mark on its reputation — the felony charge that the American aerospace giant deceived regulators who approved the airplane and the pilot-training requirements to fly it safely.\\n\\nWhat did Boeing agree to do?\\n\\nBoeing will pay another fine, bringing the total to $487.2 million, which the Justice Department says is the legal maximum for the fraud charge. The deal also requires the company to invest at least $455 million to improve safety. It will be on court-supervised probation for three years, and the Justice Department will name an independent monitor to oversee Boeing’s compliance with terms of the plea agreement.\\n\\nBoeing’s board of directors will be required to meet with families of the victims.\\n\\nCan the judge block the deal?\\n\\nYes. There will be a hearing before U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth, Texas. He can accept the agreement, in which case he can’t change terms of Boeing’s punishment. Or he can reject it, which would likely lead to new negotiations between Boeing and prosecutors. A date for the hearing has not been set.\\n\\nDeals in which the defendant and the federal government agree on a sentence are controversial in legal circles.\\n\\n“Judges don’t like them. They feel that it usurps their authority,” said Deborah Curtis, a former Justice Department lawyer.\\n\\nO’Connor, however, has shown deference before to the Justice Department’s power. When families of the crash victims tried to undo the 2021 deferred-prosecution agreement, the judge criticized what he called “Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct” but ruled that he had no authority to overturn the settlement.\\n\\nHow are relatives of the crash victims reacting?\\n\\nMany are outraged by the agreement.\\n\\nZipporah Kuria, a 28-year-old London woman whose father, Joseph, was on the Ethiopian Airlines Max that crashed in March 2019, wanted a trial that she thinks would have unearthed new details about what led up to the crashes.\\n\\nNow, with the likelihood that there will never be a trial, “the opportunity to continue digging, the opportunity to continue finding out what has gone wrong here and what is wrong, is kind of taken away from us,” Kuria said. “So yet again, they (the victims) have been robbed of their dignity, and we have been robbed of our closure.”\\n\\nJavier de Luis, an MIT aeronautics lecturer whose sister, Graziella, died in the Ethiopia crash, also finds the punishment for Boeing to be inadequate.\\n\\nREAD: Boeing posts $355-M loss as it tries to dig out from under crisis\\n\\n“If you look at the elements that make up this plea agreement, they’re pretty much typical for what you would expect to see in a white-collar fraud investigation – not in the case of a crime that led directly to the deaths of 346 people,” he said.\\n\\nNadia Milleron, a Massachusetts resident whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, died in the same crash, wants Boeing’s current and previous CEOs to face charges.\\n\\n“After the Indonesian crash, they knew that something was wrong with this plane, and they knew it could crash,” she said. “They gambled with people’s lives, and they are gambling right now.”\\n\\nWhat effect would a conviction have on Boeing?\\n\\nBoeing’s business has never fully recovered from the crashes. After the renewed scrutiny that followed the Alaska Airlines incident, the company failed to book any new orders for the Max in April and May. It has fallen even farther behind European rival Airbus in production and deliveries of new planes, which means less revenue is coming in.\\n\\nAll of this is happening while Boeing looks for a new CEO to replace David Calhoun, who says he will step down at the end of the year.\\n\\nThat said, the share price of the company’s stock rose slightly Monday.\\n\\nWill Boeing lose government contracts?\\n\\nProbably not.\\n\\nGovernment contractors can be suspended or disbarred for criminal convictions, but agencies generally have leeway to grant exceptions.\\n\\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said the Justice Department notified the Defense Department about Boeing’s plea deal.\\n\\nThe Defense Department “will assess the company’s remediation plans and agreement with the Department of Justice to make a determination as to what steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the federal government,” Ryder said.\\n\\nIn 2006, the Air Force cited “compelling national interest” to let Boeing keep competing for contracts even after the company admitted charges that included using stolen information to win a space-launch contract and paying a $615 million fine.\\n\\nDoes the plea affect other investigations into Boeing?\\n\\nIt would only resolve the fraud charge filed after the two deadly crashes. The FBI told passengers on the Alaska Airline Max that suffered a panel blowout while flying over Oregon that they might be victims of a crime.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating that incident, and the Federal Aviation Administration is looking into Boeing’s manufacturing quality.\\n\\nWhat happened in the crashes?\\n\\nBoeing added new flight-control software to the Max that could push the nose of the plane down if a sensor indicated the plane could be approaching an aerodynamic stall.

Now, his shop sits hopelessly empty.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“Right now, we’re in a dreadful crisis,” he said. “No one buys anything anymore. … We don’t know what’s going to happen.”\\n\\nREAD: Evo Morales wants UN mediation in Bolivia\\n\\nBolivians like Vargas have been hit hard by economic turmoil in the small South American nation fueled by a longtime hyper-dependence on, and now shortage of, U.S. dollars.\\n\\nThe economic downturn has been exacerbated by an ongoing feud between President Luis Arce and his ally-turned-rival former President Evo Morales in the lead-up to next year’s presidential election. Many Bolivians impacted by the crisis have lost trust in Arce, who denies the country is even in an economic crisis.\\n\\n“Bolivia has an economy that’s growing. An economy in crisis doesn’t grow,” Arce told The Associated Press in an interview. That was contradicted by both economists and dozens of Bolivians.\\n\\nThat deep distrust came to a head on Wednesday following a spectacle which the government called a “failed coup d’etat” and opponents including Morales called a staged “self-coup” meant to earn the unpopular leader political points before elections.\\n\\nWhether the coup attempt was real or not, most Bolivians who spoke to the AP said they no longer believe what their leader says, and say Arce would be better served addressing Bolivia’s gasping economy and less time carrying out political stunts.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n“He should think about Bolivia’s economy, make a plan to move forward, find a way to get dollars and work to move Bolivia forward,” Vargas said. “No more of these childish ‘self-coups.’”\\n\\nThat simmering anger has paved the way for even more strife in a country that is no stranger to political unrest.\\n\\nBolivia’s economic crisis is rooted in a complex combination of dependence on the dollar, draining international reserves, mounting debt and failures to produce products like gas, once the Andean nation’s economic boon.\\n\\nThis has meant that Bolivia has largely become an import economy “totally dependent on dollars,” said Gonzalo Chávez, an economist with Bolivia’s Catholic University. That once worked in Bolivia’s favor, driving the country’s “economic miracle” as it became one of the region’s fastest growing economies.\\n\\nREAD: Bolivia cuts diplomatic ties with Israel over Gaza conflict\\n\\nVargas’ family opened the shoe business nearly 30 years ago because they saw it as a surefire way to ensure stability for coming generations. The family imports shoes from China, which they pay for in dollars and sell them in Bolivia’s currency, bolivianos. Without dollars, they have no business.\\n\\nThe shortage of dollars has led to the emergence of a black market, with many sellers bringing in greenbacks from neighboring Peru and Chile and selling them at a gouged price.\\n\\nPascuala Quispe, 46, spent her Saturday walking around La Paz’s downtown going to different currency exchange shops, desperately searching for dollars to buy car parts. While the official exchange rate is 6.97 bolivianos to the dollar, she was told the real price was 9.30 bolivianos, far too high a price for her. So she kept walking, hoping to find luck elsewhere.\\n\\nGouged prices have trickled down to everything. People have stopped buying shoes, meat and clothing, and that has pushed working class people deeper into poverty. Bolivians make jokes about having “mattress banks,” storing cash at home because they don’t trust banks.\\n\\n“There are no jobs. … and the money we earn isn’t enough for anything,” Quispe said. “Everyone suffers.”\\n\\nSome vendors like Vargas paste signs on their business doors, hopeful sellers will trade dollars at a more reasonable price.\\n\\nIt’s a complicated economic bind that has few short-term solutions, said Chávez, the economist.\\n\\nBut Arce insists that Bolivia’s economy is “one of the most stable” and says he’s taking action to address problems ailing Bolivians, including shortages of dollars and gasoline. He said the government is also industrializing, investing in new economies like tourism and lithium.\\n\\nWhile Bolivia sits on the world’s biggest stores of lithium, a high-value metal key to transitioning to a green economy, investment is only viable in the long term, largely due to government failures, said Chávez. Meanwhile, inflation has outpaced economic growth, and most Bolivians face unstable work conditions with minuscule pay.\\n\\nThat is only compounded by ongoing fights between Arce and Morales, who returned from exile after resigning during unrest in 2019, which Morales maintains was a coup against him. Now the former allies have slung insults and fought over who will represent their Movement for Socialism party, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of 2025 elections.\\n\\nREAD: Peru bans Bolivia’s Evo Morales as political crisis simmers\\n\\n“Arce and Evo Morales, they fight over who is more powerful,” Vargas said. “But neither govern for Bolivia. … There’s a lot of uncertainty.”\\n\\nBroad discontent has fueled waves of protests and strikes in recent months. Protests and road blocks have dealt another economic blow to Vargas, the shoe vendor, because customers from all over the country no longer travel to buy products because of the chaos of ubiquitous protests.\\n\\nMorales, who still wields a great deal of power in Bolivia, blocked Arce’s government from passing measures in Congress to ease the economic turmoil, which Arce told the AP was a “political attack.”\\n\\nMorales has fueled speculation that the military assault on the government palace last week allegedly led by former military commander José Zúñiga was a political stunt organized by Arce to gain sympathy from Bolivians. The claim was first made by Zúñiga himself upon his arrest.\\n\\n“He tricked and lied to, not just the Bolivian people, but the entire world,” Morales said in a Sunday radio program.\\n\\nThe political spats left many like 35-year-old Edwin Cruz, a truck driver, shaking their heads as they wait for hours, sometimes days, in long lines for diesel and gasoline because of intermittent shortages caused by lack of foreign currency.\\n\\n“Diesel is like gold now,” he said. “People aren’t idiots. And with this whole thing with the ‘self-coup’ this government has to go.”\\n\\nREAD: Bolivians use hoses, water bottles to battle wildfire blazes\\n\\nCruz is among those who don’t want to vote for either Morales or Arce. While Bolivians have few other options, Chávez said discontent opened a “small window” for an outsider to gain traction, just as it has with a number of Latin American outsiders in recent years.\\n\\nMost recently, self-described “anarcho-capitalist” Javier Milei has taken the helm of neighboring Argentina with promises to lift the country out of its economic spiral, which shares a number of similarities with Bolivia’s.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Vargas doesn’t know what he’ll do with his family’s shoe store. Once a point of pride, the shop has turned into a financial drain. He would pass it down to one of his four children, but all of them want to leave Bolivia. One of his children has already migrated to China.\\n\\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

      "MORE Power president and CEO Roel Roel Castro said on Tuesday the multi-million project involves the supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) system, which serves as the heart of its entire power system, as well as fiber optics and point-to-point connection.Castro also said that by implementing the Scada system, which was unveiled in February this year, they would know how customers are affected for every round of interruption.MORE Power explained its centralized Scada system is the key feature of the control center capable of operating and monitoring operations in real-time not only in Iloilo and Panay but also in areas where the entity will be operating in the future. This allows the control center to respond to any issues within seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In layman’s terms, you can monitor and control the substations remotely and gather data for analysis,” Castro said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Scada system, which serves as the “brain” of the company’s distribution system, is a combination of software, hardware and intelligent programming that enables them to monitor, control, record data and forecast supply and demand situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system allows a power distributor to control circuit breakers and switch all substations remotely without a manual intervention in these facilities. That way, the personnel can be reassigned to more critical roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, the Scada system records and consolidates data and subsequently generates a simplified report to apprise operators of the power system’s current state.Other features include instantaneous fault detection to resolve issues in the power system and a 24/7 helpline to address complaints more efficiently.\n",

      "In a commentary sent to reporters on Tuesday, Diwa Guinigundo, analyst at GlobalSource, said the Marcos administration should spend more on critical infrastructure like power, as well as other priority areas such as health and education to ensure “judicious utilization” of its planned P6.352 trillion budget for 2025.Spending on those areas, Guinigundo explained, would “strengthen the country’s connectivity and digitalization” and boost production of both goods and services, which may help temper inflation and reduce poverty.\n",

      "”As some academics correctly pointed out, the bigger magnitude is no guarantee of any significant gains in economic growth or development,” he added.The inter-agency Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) last month unveiled the Marcos administration’s P6.352-trillion spending plan for 2025, which is equivalent to 22 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. The amount is 10.1 percent larger than this year’s outlay of P5.768 trillion.\n",

      "Among the GDP components, government spending grew 1.7 percent in the January to March period, lower than the 6.2-percent uptick in the first quarter of 2023. Economic officials said the El Niño onslaught had disrupted construction activities during the period, likely slowing down government expenditures on infrastructure as a result.Moving forward, the government said it would continue to catch up on its spending so it could make a bigger contribution to second-quarter GDP growth. Latest Treasury data showed state spending amounted to P2.3 trillion year-to-date, up by 17.65 percent.\n",

      "Apart from wiser spending, GlobalSource’s Guinigundo said a “sustainable financing” to bridge a large budget deficit is also key to higher economic growth.

      "\n",
      "Just a few years ago, the 45-year-old Vargas would unlock the doors at 8 a.m. to a crush of customers already waiting to buy tennis shoes imported from China. Now, his shop sits hopelessly empty.“Right now, we’re in a dreadful crisis,” he said. “No one buys anything anymore. … We don’t know what’s going to happen.”Bolivians like Vargas have been hit hard by economic turmoil in the small South American nation fueled by a longtime hyper-dependence on, and now shortage of, U.S. dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The economic downturn has been exacerbated by an ongoing feud between President Luis Arce and his ally-turned-rival former President Evo Morales in the lead-up to next year’s presidential election. Many Bolivians impacted by the crisis have lost trust in Arce, who denies the country is even in an economic crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bolivia has an economy that’s growing. An economy in crisis doesn’t grow,” Arce told The Associated Press in an interview. That was contradicted by both economists and dozens of Bolivians.\n",
      "\n",
      "That deep distrust came to a head on Wednesday following a spectacle which the government called a “failed coup d’etat” and opponents including Morales called a staged “self-coup” meant to earn the unpopular leader political points before elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the coup attempt was real or not, most Bolivians who spoke to the AP said they no longer believe what their leader says, and say Arce would be better served addressing Bolivia’s gasping economy and less time carrying out political stunts.“He should think about Bolivia’s economy, make a plan to move forward, find a way to get dollars and work to move Bolivia forward,” Vargas said. “No more of these childish ‘self-coups.’”\n",

      "\n",
      "This has meant that Bolivia has largely become an import economy “totally dependent on dollars,” said Gonzalo Chávez, an economist with Bolivia’s Catholic University. That once worked in Bolivia’s favor, driving the country’s “economic miracle” as it became one of the region’s fastest growing economies.Vargas’ family opened the shoe business nearly 30 years ago because they saw it as a surefire way to ensure stability for coming generations. The family imports shoes from China, which they pay for in dollars and sell them in Bolivia’s currency, bolivianos. Without dollars, they have no business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shortage of dollars has led to the emergence of a black market, with many sellers bringing in greenbacks from neighboring Peru and Chile and selling them at a gouged price.\n",

      "Pascuala Quispe, 46, spent her Saturday walking around La Paz’s downtown going to different currency exchange shops, desperately searching for dollars to buy car parts. While the official exchange rate is 6.97 bolivianos to the dollar, she was told the real price was 9.30 bolivianos, far too high a price for her. So she kept walking, hoping to find luck elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gouged prices have trickled down to everything. People have stopped buying shoes, meat and clothing, and that has pushed working class people deeper into poverty. Bolivians make jokes about having “mattress banks,” storing cash at home because they don’t trust banks.\n",

      "\n",
      "While Bolivia sits on the world’s biggest stores of lithium, a high-value metal key to transitioning to a green economy, investment is only viable in the long term, largely due to government failures, said Chávez. Meanwhile, inflation has outpaced economic growth, and most Bolivians face unstable work conditions with minuscule pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is only compounded by ongoing fights between Arce and Morales, who returned from exile after resigning during unrest in 2019, which Morales maintains was a coup against him. Now the former allies have slung insults and fought over who will represent their Movement for Socialism party, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of 2025 elections.“Arce and Evo Morales, they fight over who is more powerful,” Vargas said. “But neither govern for Bolivia. … There’s a lot of uncertainty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Broad discontent has fueled waves of protests and strikes in recent months. Protests and road blocks have dealt another economic blow to Vargas, the shoe vendor, because customers from all over the country no longer travel to buy products because of the chaos of ubiquitous protests.\n",

      "\n",
      "“He tricked and lied to, not just the Bolivian people, but the entire world,” Morales said in a Sunday radio program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political spats left many like 35-year-old Edwin Cruz, a truck driver, shaking their heads as they wait for hours, sometimes days, in long lines for diesel and gasoline because of intermittent shortages caused by lack of foreign currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Diesel is like gold now,” he said. “People aren’t idiots. And with this whole thing with the ‘self-coup’ this government has to go.”Cruz is among those who don’t want to vote for either Morales or Arce. While Bolivians have few other options, Chávez said discontent opened a “small window” for an outsider to gain traction, just as it has with a number of Latin American outsiders in recent years.\n",

      "Meanwhile, Vargas doesn’t know what he’ll do with his family’s shoe store. Once a point of pride, the shop has turned into a financial drain. He would pass it down to one of his four children, but all of them want to leave Bolivia. One of his children has already migrated to China.\n",

The Federal Aviation Administration soon after announced increased oversight of Boeing and Spirit.The Justice Department said in a May court filing that Boeing violated terms of a 2021 settlement allowing the company to avoid prosecution for actions leading up to two deadly crashes involving the company’s 737 Max jetliners more than five years ago.\\n\\nThe Justice Department is pushing Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud in connection with two deadly plane crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners, according to several people who heard federal prosecutors detail a proposed offer Sunday.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoeing has until the end of the week to accept or reject the offer, which includes the giant aerospace company agreeing to an independent monitor who would oversee its compliance with anti-fraud laws, they said.')]"
